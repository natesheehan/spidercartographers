        <h4>Transportation surrounds us in every facet of life. Pavements lead us to our supermarkets where we can fill up our hungry bellies. Road and train networks journey us across vast stretches of land to see every corner of our nation, and
          bikes and
          buses connect us to our family and friends after long days at work and school. We have all become familiar with and used to the luxuries of transportation. Now, as the world shifts towards more sustainable modes of transport, maybe it's
          time to see what we could improve. </br> </br>
          Transportation has been explored from many different strands of literature, with each researcher's bias emphasising different aspects. As a group of multidisciplinary data scientists from various corners of the world who are bound together
          by a passion for transportation, we believe it's worth exploring the UK’s transportation characteristics to subsequently inform ways in which policies could be targeted to certain areas to alter transport modes. To understand this, we draw
          upon demographic factors are likely to influence transportation choice, and where similarities and differences are found within the UK. So join us, for an exploration of transportation usage in the UK...

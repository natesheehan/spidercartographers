        <h4 class="openText">Transportation surrounds us in every facet of life. Pavements lead us to our supermarkets where we can fill up our hungry bellies. Road and train networks journey us
          across vast stretches of land
          to see every corner of our nation, and
          bikes and
          buses connect us to our family and friends after long days at work and school. We have all become familiar with and used to the luxuries of transportation. Now, as the world shifts towards more sustainable modes of transport, maybe it's
          time to see what we could improve. </br> </br>
          Transportation has been explored from many different strands of literature, with each researcher's bias emphasising different aspects. As a group of multidisciplinary data scientists from various corners of the world who are bound together
          by a passion for transportation, we believe it's worth exploring the UK’s transportation characteristics to subsequently inform ways in which policies could be targeted to certain areas to alter transport modes. To understand this, we draw
          upon demographic factors are likely to influence transportation choice, and where similarities and differences are found within the UK. So join us, for an exploration of transportation usage in the UK...

          <h2> Total MSOA Travel </h2>
          <p class="totalTravelMSOAText">The UK is big, and when it comes to transportation, there is huge variation in accessibility and mode share within MSOA’s. What is an MSOA you ask? A Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA) is a geospatial
            statistic
            used in England and
            Wales.
            Created by the Office for National Statistics it is used to understand small areas of the country. The mean population of an MSOA is 7,200, with a minimum population of 5000. The 2011 census reports 7,201 MSOAs in England and Wales. </br>
            </br> Our analysis shows within the average MSOA commute is dominated by car travel. 60% of people travelling to work are travelling by car, this is complemented by 74% of all households in the UK owning cars. The second most
            popular method for
            travelling to work is 10% of people who travel to work on foot (not accounting for those who work from home at 10.4%). This is then followed by bus, train and metro/underground/tram suggesting that public transport compromises around 15%
            of the
            journeys to work in England and Wales.</br>

          Given the difference in size and population of urban areas in the UK, comparisons of total figures would be misleading. We therefore look at MSOA level values to understand the differentiation between transport patterns across the UK. The
          most
          obvious discrepancy is between rural and urban areas, where people in rural areas are more reliant on cars than their urban counterparts.</p>

          But such a crude categorization fails to show the variation between urban areas. For example we can look at similar transport breakdown between London and Birmingham. This shows that even between urban areas there is differentiation in
          terms of transport usage. However it is noted there is variation within these urban areas as well, thus we can even further down in scale to the MSOA level. </br> </br> Surprisingly, we see that Birmingham has the highest average number of
          bus stops per MSOA, but is that an indication of better public transport availability in Birmingham than London. Definitely not. Due to the population differences, Birmingham is divided into 135 MSOAs while London is divided into 978.
          Getting summary statistics by city leads to misleading conclusions like the one above, and prevents us from understanding the variation within each city. But is there variation? You bet. </p>

            <h2> Discussion about travel types in cities </h2>
            <p class="cityText">Let’s take London and plot the number of bus stops in each MSOA. Below is a histogram showing that variation. A what? A histogram shows the distribution of a certain variable; in our case it is count of Bus
              stops. The height of a bar
              shows the number of MSOAs that have a certain number of bus stops. For example, there are around 20 MSOAs that have 0-5 bus stops, and almost 250 MSOAs that have 15-20 bus stops (highest bar). Interestingly, there is a smaller number of
              MSOAs with over 150 bus stops! </br> </br> So yes, London may be better served than any other area in the UK, but services in London are by no means uniformly distributed. Is it possible that some areas of London have worse service than
              other urban areas in the UK? The answer to that question, and many others, lies at the MSOA level.</p>

        <p class="transportTextAcess">What transport mode people choose to get to work can, of course, depend on access to different modes within the MSOA. In terms of stations, bus stops are by far
          the most common, with an average of 38.5 stops per MSOA. There are 277,094 bus stations across England and Wales. Only 1,811 out of 7,201 MSOAs have train stations, for a total of 2,305 train stations. An average MSOA has 0.32 train
          stations.
          This is even lower
          for metro, tram or underground stations, as only 535 MSOAs have these stations for a total of 899 stations in England and Wales. This means that the average MSOA has only 0.128 stations. </p>

          traveling by car has the most accessibility, and those that do travel by car on average travel for 12 minutes to their workplace. While bus may be the slowest for travelling to other MSOAs, those that travel by bus to work spend an
          average of 28 minutes, followed by those travelling by rail who spend an average of 67 minutes. </p>

        <p class="boxPlotText"> If there is significant variation in car usage then this should also show up in other modes of transport, as public transport may offer an appealing alternative. The
          averages for underground/tram/metro, train and bus usage is 3.4%, 4.7% and 7.3% respectively, and we can see that there is considerable variation across MSOAs. In the
          MSOAs with the lowest percentage use for each of these modes of transport is less than 1% which is associated with considerable reliance on private vehicle travel. However, some MSOAs show significant usage of each of these travel
          modes, with the largest for underground/tram/metro, train and bus usage being 55.7%, 46% and 45.5% respectively. </p>

        <p class="transportBoxPlotText"> Furthermore, looking at the distribution of bus stops, train stations and metro stations, there is variation across England and Wales. This includes where they are located and their
          concentration. For example,
          looking at
          the bus stops picture it can be seen that there are a significant number of bus stops across the map, with the maximum in an MSOA of 189 and the lowest of 0 (although there are only two MSOAs with no bus stops). However, the distribution is
          more clearly spread across the UK compared to that of metro/underground and tram stations and train stations. For metro/underground and tram stations it can be seen that these are highly concentrated in certain areas, with most being found
          in
          large MSOAs such as London. The highest for this is 12 stations in a single MSOA with only 535 MSOAs having these types of stations. Then we have train stations for which the we can see they are more of them across England and Wales, mostly
          surrounding cities and towns and showing the train transport corridors across the UK. 1811 MSOAs have train stations, with the highest again being 12, with the lowest being 0.</p>

          seen in the bar chart
          below. This shows that
          while the minimum for public and people powered transport in MSOAs is 0.7% and 2.0% respectively, the maximum for these ranges all the way up to 74.6% and 53.8%. These are significantly different to the average MSOA in which 60% travel to
          work by car. The mean and median for this is also shown with the medians of 10% and 10.3%, and the mean of 15.4% and 12.4% respectively, showing that the values near to the max positively affect the mean of the distributions and as such

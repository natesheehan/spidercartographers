      <h4>Transportation surrounds us in every facet of life. Pavements lead us to our supermarkets to fill up our hungry bellies. Road and train networks journey us across vast stretches of land to see every corner of our nation and bikes and buses connect us to our family and friends after long days of work and school. We have all become familiar and used to the luxuries of transportation, however now as the world shifts towards more sustainable modes of transport, maybe it's time to see what we have been taking for granted? </br> </br>
      Transportation has been explored from many different strands of literature, with each researcher's bias emphasising different things. As a group of multidisciplinary data scientists, from various corners of the world, who are bound together by a passion for transportation, we believe it's worth exploring the UK’s transportation characteristics to subsequently inform ways in which policies could be targeted to certain areas to alter transport modes. To understand this, we draw upon what demographic factors are likely to influence transportation choice and where similarities and differences are found within the UK. So join us, for an exploration of transportation usage in the UK…. </h4>

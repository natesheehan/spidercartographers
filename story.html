        <p class="spatialScaleText">For this analysis, we used census data per middle layer super output area (MSOA). An MSOA is a geospatial statistic used in England and Wales that was created by the Office for National Statistics. It is used to
          understand small areas of the country. The 2011 census reports 7,201 MSOAs with a mean population of 7,200 people and a minimum population of 5,000. While in some cases it may be helpful to aggregate MSOA data into larger geographical
          areas, the below sections will demonstrate the issues of such aggregation for our analysis of transport characteristics. We start with aggregated, national level statistics and work our way down to the MSOA level to show that variations
          exist at all spatial scales.</p>

            only accounts for roughly 28% of total travel share. This suggests transportation in its current form is not prepared to help combat the climate crisis. However, given the disparities in transport access and socio-economic conditions
            across England and Wales, total figures don’t show the full story. The most obvious discrepancy is between rural and urban areas.</p>

        <p class="ruralUrbanText">As seen in the pie charts above, both urban and rural populations are highly reliant on cars, although this is much more pronounced in rural areas. Taking the bus is more common in urban places, potentially due to
          the larger number of bus stops per MSOA. The share of people working from home is much larger in rural communities, but in light of the COVID-19 pandemic we expect this will increase in urban constituencies. Walking continues to be an
          important mode of transport for both geographies, perhaps demonstrating that people will choose to walk when they can.</br> </br>But such a crude categorization fails to show the variation amongst urban areas. For example, the next section
          breaks down the transportation differences between London and Birmingham. </p>

            Birmingham’s average car share is almost double London’s, but London has far more commuting by the Underground and train due to mass investment in infrastructure. This is highlighted by the fact that London has its vast Underground
            network,
            whereas Birmingham has only a single metro line. Thus, there are differences in accessibility to various transport modes between these two cities. This is indicative of variation that may exist amongst all cities in England and Wales.
            </br> </br>
            However, even this level of disaggregation is insufficient as it ignores the variation that exists within cities. In other words, an MSOA in Birmingham may be more similar to an MSOA elsewhere than to another MSOA in Birmingham.

        <p class="transportTextAcess">Looking at public transport accessibility, bus stops are by far the most prevalent type of transport facility. There are over 270,000 bus stops across England and Wales, with only two MSOAs having no bus stops at
          all. </br> </br>That being said, other public transportation modes are less commonplace. Only a fourth of MSOAs have train stations at all, showcasing an uneven distribution in public transportation infrastructure. This is even more
          apparent when looking at metro, tram and underground stations. There are a total of 899 metro, tram and underground stations in England and Wales, with only eight percent of MSOAs containing one.</p>

          transport. We can see that while some MSOAs have low shares of sustainable transport, others have extremely high levels of public transport usage or active travel. It is useful to compare the high usage cases to the average use of each of
          these modes across England and Wales and to highlight that higher levels of sustainable transport usage are possible in some places. </p>

          transport profile could be identified. To do so, we used the transport characteristics discussed above, such as commuting mode shares, car ownership and travel time accessibility by different modes to represent the transport profile of an
          MSOA. </br> </br>We used a clustering algorithm to group the MSOAs into distinct transport profiles. Clustering algorithms group data points to maximize similarity within groups and minimize it between them. Our clustering revealed five

            are mainly in the center of England and Wales, compared to the rural areas in profile 2, which are on the outskirts.
            This cluster has the second best accessibility scores for all measured transport modes due to the central locations. The cluster benefits from being on train routes and has the second highest train usage, but that is the only mode of
            public transport that the MSOAs in this cluster are serviced by. As a result, the cluster is associated with high car ownership and usage, followed by train and walking.</p>

            cars to move around. They have poor accessibility even by car, and this could be due to a lack of direct road and other connections between them and other parts of the country. The cluster is found on the periphery of profile 3, which is
            itself made up of coastal urban areas with poor accessibility.</p>

            train usage, working from home and all around accessibility. The most popular modes to travel to work are by car, by walking and bus, but the lack of accessibility across all modes and little train usage is the defining feature. This can
            be found in coastal towns and cities such as Newcastle, Cardiff and Blackpool, which might suggest the MSOAs are at the end of train lines and other transport networks and therefore lack external connectivity.</p>

        <p class="peopleAndPublicTransportText"> As an additional step we began to explore how, if at all, transport profiles relate to demographic characteristics. We attempt to answer this through a classification analysis, which is explained in detail in <a href="./assets/data/Methodology_SC.pdf">our methodology </a>. The classification analysis was performed using a Random Forest Classification algorithm, including factors which have been found to be related to transport usage like population density, net annual income, and mean age. 65% of MSOAs were able to be correctly classified by the demographic factors, with population density and net annual income being the most important factors relating to the identification of the transport profile.</p>

      <p class="peopleAndPublicTransportText"> An example of one of the decision trees from the algorithm can be seen above. It shows us how the algorithm worked to predict which transport profile an MSOA belonged to. For example, transport profile 4 (high public transport and good accessibility) is associated with an income above £33,850 with the percentage of households owned being greater than 59.25%. In contrast, transport profile 1 (good train accessibility but car dependent) is associated with an income below £33,850 and a mean age of less than 38.25 years. The issue, however, is that this is one of many decision trees created by the algorithm. To get a better understanding of the result of the classification, it would be necessary to examine more trees. This would help inform us as to which demographic factors are related to the cluster outputs. </p>

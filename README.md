This document is a step by step guide to download, pull, branch and push to the repository.

Download and install sourcetree to your local computer `(https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)`

Go to https://github.com/natesheehan/spidercartographers and choose `clone repository with https`. Copy this URL.

Go to Sourcetree and `click new` > `clone from URL`

Paste the URL into the source URL box and wait a minute for the other boxes to automatically fill.

Press the `clone` button and begin download of the repository.

Once it has downloaded, click on the repository and click on the `Branch` button, MAKE SURE CURRENT BRANCH IS SET TO MASTER

Add your initals followed by - to seperate words. I made an example branch called “ns-example-branch”, do something similar, we can make funny branch names in due course.

Click `create branch`.

Open the project in your code editor, I would reccommend we all use `https://atom.io/`

Make a change to the project, anything you want!

Go back to Sourcetree, under the Workspace tab, click on `File Status`, from here you should be able to see the change you have made.

Make sure you tick all the boxes for the files you have changed and wish to commit and add a commit message, be sure to add [Your initals] at the beginging, so we know who has comitted where. Once this is done press the `commit` button.

Ask another person in the group to look at the changes you have made and ask them to verify on our group slack that “Your branch name” has passed “code review”.

Once verified, go back to Sourcetree and go double click on the master branch (You can only do this once you have comitted/pushed your code). Left click on your branch and click `Merge [branch name] into master`.

You might have to push after doing this, but after that voila, you are done!

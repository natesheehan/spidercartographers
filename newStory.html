  <h4>Transportation surrounds us in every facet of life. Pavements lead us to our supermarkets where we can fill up our hungry bellies. Road and train networks journey us across vast stretches of land to see every corner of our nation, and
    bikes and
    buses connect us to our family and friends after long days at work and school. We have all become familiar with and used to the luxuries of transportation. Now, as the world shifts towards more sustainable modes of transport, maybe it's
    time to see what we could improve. </br> </br>
    Transportation has been explored from many different strands of literature, with each researcher's bias emphasising different aspects. As a group of multidisciplinary data scientists from various corners of the world who are bound together
    by a passion for transportation, we believe it's worth exploring the UK’s transportation characteristics to subsequently inform ways in which policies could be targeted to certain areas to alter transport modes. To understand this, we draw
    upon demographic factors are likely to influence transportation choice, and where similarities and differences are found within the UK. So join us, for an exploration of transportation usage in the UK...

      <h2> Total MSOA Travel </h2>
      <p>The UK is big, and when it comes to transportation, there is huge variation in accessibility and mode share within MSOA’s. What is an MSOA you ask? A Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA) is a geospatial statistic used in England and Wales.
        Created by the Office for National Statistics it is used to understand small areas of the country. The mean population of an MSOA is 7,200, with a minimum population of 5000. The 2011 census reports 7,201 MSOAs in England and Wales. </br> </br> Our analysis shows within the average MSOA commute is dominated by car travel. 60% of people travelling to work are travelling by car, this is complemented by 74% of all households in the UK owning cars. The second most
        popular method for
        travelling to work is 10% of people who travel to work on foot (not accounting for those who work from home at 10.4%). This is then followed by bus, train and metro/underground/tram suggesting that public transport compromises around 15% of the
        journeys to work in England and Wales.</br>

    Given the difference in size and population of urban areas in the UK, comparisons of total figures would be misleading. We therefore look at MSOA level values to understand the differentiation between transport patterns across the UK. The most
    obvious discrepancy is between rural and urban areas, where people in rural areas are more reliant on cars than their urban counterparts.</p>

      But such a crude categorization fails to show the variation between urban areas. For example we can look at similar transport breakdown between London and Birmingham. This shows that even between urban areas there is differentiation in terms of transport usage. However it is noted there is variation within these urban areas as well, thus we can even further down in scale to the MSOA level. </br> </br> Surprisingly, we see that Birmingham has the highest average number of bus stops per MSOA, but is that an indication of better public transport availability in Birmingham than London. Definitely not. Due to the population differences, Birmingham is divided into 135 MSOAs while London is divided into 978. Getting summary statistics by city leads to misleading conclusions like the one above, and prevents us from understanding the variation within each city. But is there variation? You bet. </p>

          <h2> Discussion about travel types in cities </h2>
          <p>Let’s take London and plot the number of bus stops in each MSOA. Below is a histogram showing that variation. A what? A histogram shows the distribution of a certain variable; in our case it is count of Bus stops. The height of a bar shows the number of MSOAs that have a certain number of bus stops. For example, there are around 20 MSOAs that have 0-5 bus stops, and almost 250 MSOAs that have 15-20 bus stops (highest bar). Interestingly, there is a smaller number of MSOAs with over 150 bus stops! </br> </br> So yes, London may be better served than any other area in the UK, but services in London are by no means uniformly distributed. Is it possible that some areas of London have worse service than other urban areas in the UK? The answer to that question, and many others, lies at the MSOA level.</p>

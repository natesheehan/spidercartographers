We believe it's worth exploring the transportation characteristics to subsequently inform ways in which policies could be targeted to certain areas to alter transport modes.</p>

                    <p class="aboutPage">The project's goal is to inspire a dialogue about transport modes, availability and choice in England and Wales. The aim of our analysis and website is to be able to understand how transport usage within England and Wales differs and what factors are likely to affect this. The purpose of which is that a deeper understanding of the geographical differences in transport choice could inform national and local travel policies to move towards more sustainable modes of transport. </p>

                    <p class="aboutPage">To understand the UK's transportation characteristics, we draw upon demographic factors are likely to influence transportation choice, and where similarities and differences are found.Â We have undertaken a geodemographic approach at the MSOA level to create different groups of transport profiles and further performed classification analysis to understand what demographic factors are related to these profiles. The results of these, and the subsequent visualisations, show how transport usage profiles change across the UK, from which policy could derive understanding as to where policies are required to move towards more sustainable modes of transport.
